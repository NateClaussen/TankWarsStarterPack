# TankWarsStarterPack
##Starter Pack with Tank Templates to help get started in creating your own TankWars Tank.
Players will create a tank that inherits from PlayerTankto compete in the arena and dominate against other tanks. 
## Objective

####Be the last tank standing! 

Winners are determined by the amount of points a tank accumulates by the end of a match. Even if a tank is not the last onen standing, they could potentially not get first
place (very, very, VERY unlikely!)

This is how points are determined at the end of the match:

* 15 points if you are the only tank left in the arena
* 10 points for every life you have left
* 5 points for every kill you get
* 2.5 points for every almost Kill you get (your shot was within 2 spaces from the opponent tank, but they dodged it)
* 10 \* bullet accuracy (which is determined by ((Kills + AlmostKills) / Total shots)
* 1 point if you are a super tank by the end of the match. 

##What can YOU do?
